# KTANE Bot
Voice activated bot for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes

## TODO
- Test each module for word/letter/number recognition (will prob need helper functions to fix)
- test each module, and make similar commands for same module distinguishable
- Make bot respond if it doesnt receive enough info for a module, or if it cant find what its supposed to due to bad input
- Make each stateful module reset itself once its spoken the final result
- Add defused/exploded commands for fun
- Make bot prompt for info if its still needed, like how many batteries, so you dont have to give that info at the start
- Document how to use in the readme
