- Make each stateful module reset itself once its spoken the final result
- Move global module vars into constants file
- Move module methods into their own files
- Test each module for word/letter/number recognition (will prob need helper functions to fix)
- Add defused/exploded commands for fun
- Make bot prompt for info if its still needed, like how many batteries, so you dont have to give that info at the start
